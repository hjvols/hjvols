								<h2 class="major">About HJV</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="Land Survey" /></span>
								<p>The name HJV carries a long-standing reputation of providing exemplary surveying services throughout Southern Ontario.  This reputation is built on nearly 60 years of industry practice.  We are continually evolving our methods to reflect the advancements in surveying technology while preserving our stature as a firm dedicated to accuracy and detail.  From the initial research of a property, to the final registration of a plan, and everything in between; we leave no stone unturned.  Combined with experienced field crews and a rigorous checking process, our surveys are delivered with absolute confidence. </p>
								<br>
								<h2 class="major">Our History</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/hcm.jpg" alt="Ontario Land Surveyor" /></span>
								<p>The company was initially formed in 1961 by P.T. Holding O.L.S..  In 1973, Russell Jones O.L.S. joined forces with Mr. Holding to create Holding & Jones Limited where they maintained a successful practice until Mr. Holdingâ€™s retirement in 1990.  Mr. Jones would remain president of the company until 2012 and retired in 2016. </p>
								<p>Gary B. Vanderveen O.L.S. joined Holding & Jones Limited in 1995.  In 2001, Mr. Vanderveen acquired shares in the company and the company was renamed Holding Jones Vanderveen Inc. (HJV).  Mr. Vanderveen became president in 2012 upon acquiring further shares and has since remained in this position.</p>
								<p>Thomas R. Reed O.L.S. began his employment with Holding & Jones Limited in 1989 and remained until his departure in 2008.  In 2012, Mr. Reed returned to HJV a member of the AOLS and became principal.  He has remained in this position since.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Land Developers</h2>																				
								<p>From a simple lot severance, to multiple lot subdivisions, to condominium projects, we have the experience and expertise to facilitate your successful development. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/subdivisions.jpg" alt="Toronto Land Surveyor" /></span>						
								<ul class="alt">
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Subdivisions</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>A registered Plan of Subdivision is a legal document which shows the exact surveyed boundaries and dimensions of lots on which houses or buildings are to be built, the location, width and names of streets, and the sites of any future schools or parks. </p>
													<p>A registered Plan of Subdivision creates new, separate parcels of land and can be legally used for the sale of lots.</p>
													<p>Having worked alongside some of Canada's largest developers over multiple decades, we are subdivision specialists.  Whether it be the development of a few lots or a few hundred lots, our team can provide the surveying services necessary to see your subdivision through.</p>
													<br>
													<a href="images/subdivision_pl.jpg" target="_blank" class="button icon fa-download">Example</a>
												</div></li>
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Land Severances / Reference Plans</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Being one of our most requested services, reference plans are graphical representations and legal descriptions of land.  They show the surveyed boundary and dimensions as well as any physical or documentary evidence that could affect the title to the property.  This may include the location of fences, hedges, retaining walls, overhead wires, etc.  Buildings or other improvements on the property are generally not shown, unless they were used to position the boundary, or they encroach on the property.  A reference plan is necessary for a severance.</p>													
													<br>
													<a href="images/ref_pl.jpg" target="_blank" class="button icon fa-download">Example</a>
												</div></li>
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Condominiums</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Like a Plan of Subdivision, a Condominium Plan creates new parcels of land called units.  Units are three-dimensional, with boundaries being the physical surfaces of the buildings themselves (this excludes vacant land condominiums).  A Condominium Plan shows the exact boundaries and dimensions of each unit across all floors of the condominium.</p>
													<p>The preparation of Condominium Plans is one of our areas of expertise.  We have extensive experience providing surveying services for all types of condominiums.</p>
													<br>
													<a href="images/condo_pl.pdf" target="_blank" class="button icon fa-download">Example</a>
												</div></li>			
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Topographic Surveys</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Topographic surveys are plans that show the physical properties of a site.  These plans may be used by engineers, architects, and planners to assist with the detailed design of a development proposal.  A topographic survey may compliment a development application.  It shows the physical constraints that the proponent must consider in a development application, or a detailed design of a site for development purposes.</p>
													<p>We specialize in preparing topographic surveys, which show vertical elevations, contours, as well as physical details above and on the ground.  Contours are lines on the drawing that join points that have the same elevation on the ground.  Contour lines never cross each other, and the close the lines are to each other, the steeper the slope.  Conversely, the further apart the lines are from each other, the flatter the slope.</p>
													<br>
													<a href="images/topo_pl.pdf" target="_blank" class="button icon fa-download">Example</a>
												</div></li>
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Frontage and Area Certificates</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Confirm the area, lot frontage, and lot width of a land parcel with a Frontage and Area Certificate.</p>
													<br>
													
												</div></li>
										<li><h4 class="accordion">SRPR / Title / ALTA Surveys</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Being one of our most requested services, a Surveyor's Real Property Report (SRPR) is prepared specifically to illustrate the location of buildings or structures relative to the boundaries of a unit of land.  It also shows the location of any other physical features and registered encumbrances, such as easements, on or immediately adjacent to the property.  In a real estate transaction, a current SRPR provides the purchaser, the seller, the lending institution, the municipality, the realtor, and all other parties to the transaction with an accurate representation of the property prior to the purchase being completed.</p>
													<br>
													<a href="images/comsrpr_pl.jpg" target="_blank" class="button icon fa-download">Example</a>
												</div></li>
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Construction Layout</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Errors in construction can cost a fortune in time and money.  Ensure structures such as buildings, services, or roads are constructed according to design with a construction layout survey.  With our on-demand service, we will have a crew on-site to stake out reference points which help in guiding the construction process.</p>
													<br>
													
												</div></li>
										<li><h4 class="accordion">Natural Heritage System Surveys</h4>
												<div class="panel">
													<p>Establish and certify the lines and limits of areas which require protection.  The Provincial Policy Statement, 2014, defines a natural heritage system as:</p>
													<blockquote>"a system made up of natural heritage features and areas, and linkages intended to provide connectivity and support natural processes which are necessary to maintain biological and geological diversity, natural functions, viable populations of indigenous species, and ecosystems.  These systems can include natural heritage features and areas, federal and provincial parks and conservation reserves, other natural heritage features, lands that have been restored or have the potential to be restored to a natural state, areas that support hydrologic functions, and working landscapes that enable ecological functions to continue."</blockquote>
													<p>We are very familiar in working alongside conservation authorities, engineers, and environmental engineers in accurately determining these natural heritage system lines.</p>
